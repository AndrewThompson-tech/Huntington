- set up API calls for data -> FRED has some but also databento credits

- review stats, come up with a plan on what data is useful, really look at the graphs and describe what they could mean

- Sophisticate workflow
    - Ensure master_table dates line up with the stock/ETF
    - Organize folders, put spreadsheets in one area
